# STC TV Data Analysis and Prediction

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data analysis, and prediction on STC TV data. The project includes the following steps:

## EDA and Data Analysis

In this section, the project analyzes the STC TV data and creates visualizations to help understand the data.

## Prediction

The prediction section of the project uses machine learning models to predict the total watch time in hours. The code snippet includes the following steps:

1. Create columns for X (input) and y (output).
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Initialize a linear regression model.
4. Train the model on the training data.
5. Predict the output on the testing set.
6. Calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions.
7. Print the RMSE.
8. Create a dictionary of input values for the prediction.
9. Create a dataframe of the input values.
10. Predict the output using the ensemble model.
11. Format and print the predicted value.

## Clustering

In this section, the project uses clustering algorithms to group the data into clusters based on similarity.
